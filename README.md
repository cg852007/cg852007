<h1>Hi, I'm Chris!</h1>
 I started a github to track all the projects I do. I thought it would be nice to have them all in one spot just in case I wanted to look something up later. Or maybe someone will see some of these and have suggestions that I can learn from. Most of these are probably going to be me following along through other people's guides and what not, at least until I learn more and can start creating my own. I'm kind of hoping these will also help find a job... that would be GREAT!</h1>
